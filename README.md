## Currently known problems to be fixed

- [ ] Fix table edit and delete panel on hover.
- [ ] Electron's setMinimumSize is bugged / not working (on windows only).
- [x] Connection with database timeouts and ends on its own (ECONNRESET).
- [ ] According to [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47875097/add-element-to-a-state-react), Components should not be stored in nor rendered from state. Hence, the Login page should be rewritten with respect to good practice.
- [ ] Changing language or theme closes the currently open page.
- [ ] Closing a tab also routes to the page.
- [ ] Should route to '/' page when closing the currently open tab but blinks out immediately instead.
- [x] Template states cause memory leaks.
- [ ] Changing languages does not change already open titles and tab labels.

Note: List is still incomplete.
